# Scope


# Basic definitions

Basic terminology used herein is based on definitions stated in "Control Valve Terminology" [-@ANSI_ISA-75.05.01_2000_R2005] or applicable IEC standards.

- Flow coefficient: Flow coefficient is a constant ($K_v$) related to the geometry of a valve plus cylinder (obturator) for a given valve opening that can be used to predict flow rate; see ANSI/ISA-75.01.01 (IEC 60534-2-1 Mod)-2007, "Flow Equations for Sizing Control Valves," [-@ANSI_ISA-75.01.01_2007] and ANSI/ISA-75.02.01-2008, "Control Valve Capacity Test Procedures" [-@ANSI_ISA-75.02.01_2008].
