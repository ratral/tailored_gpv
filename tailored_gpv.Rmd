# Scope

The inherent and installed flow characteristic, the relationship between flow coefficient and valve stroke, has been a subject of misunderstandings and endless debate with water transport and distribution systems operators. 

The control valves must be analyzed from the perspective of their *inherent characteristics* and their system behavior (*Installed characteristics*). The *“inherent flow characteristic”* is the relationship between the flow rate through a valve and the travel of the closure member as the closure member is moved from the closed position to-rated travel with a constant pressure drop across the valve. *The Inherent flow characteristics* are determined under laboratory conditions. But, what interests hydraulic design engineers, control engineers, and automation engineers are *the installed flow characteristics*. *“The Installed flow characteristics”* include both the valve and pipeline effects. In other words, One crucial requirement in selecting the proper control valve is ensuring that the valve has the properly *installed flow characteristic*. *The installed flow characteristic* usually differs from the inherent due to changes in pressure drop: as flow increases, there is less pressure drop available across the valve. It’s generally desirable to have a linear installed characteristic.

# Basic definitions

Basic terminology used herein is based on definitions stated in "Control Valve Terminology" [-@ANSI_ISA-75.05.01_2000_R2005] or applicable IEC standards.

- **Flow coefficient:** Flow coefficient is a constant ($K_v$) related to the geometry of a valve plus cylinder (obturator) for a given valve opening that can be used to predict flow rate; see ANSI/ISA-75.01.01 (IEC 60534-2-1 Mod)-2007, "Flow Equations for Sizing Control Valves," [@ANSI_ISA-75.01.01_2007] and ANSI/ISA-75.02.01-2008, "Control Valve Capacity Test Procedures" [-@ANSI_ISA-75.02.01_2008].

- **Inherent flow characteristic:** The Inherent flow characteristic is the relationship between the flow rate through a valve and the travel of the closure member as the closure member is moved from the closed position to-rated travel with a constant pressure drop across the valve [@ISA-75.11_2013]. The Inherent flow characteristics are determined under laboratory conditions by testing the valve flow versus valve position or travel using a constant differential pressure drop across the valve through the test. Manufacturers publish the inherent flow characteristics for each control valve plus the cylinder. The Inherent flow characteristics are standardized for a fixed pressure drop as defined using the valve flow coefficient value $K_v$. 

- **Inherent flow characteristic curves:** Control valves can be mounted with different cylinders in such a way as to present different performance curves for the percentage of rated $K_{v_{max}}$ versus the percent of rated travel of the cylinder. There are three basic characteristics: Quick opening; Linear and Equal percentage.

- **Relative flow coefficient ($\phi$):**  The relative flow coefficient is the flow coefficient ($K_{v_{max}}$) ratio at a stated full open to the flow coefficient ($K_{v}$) at rated travel [@ISA-75.11_2013].


# Example A

It is a simple water transport system between two reservoirs, which are $500 \; meters$ apart, and the elevation of the deposits is $100$ and $5 \; meters$, respectively. Before the entrance to the second tank, a control valve has been installed (see Flow Schematic).

```{r figure_sample_01, out.width='100%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='Flow Schematic'}
    knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images","figure_01.jpg"))
```
```{r}
  dn <- 250 # Diameter of the valve 

  tb <- hyd4gpv:::gpv_data %>% 
    filter(brand == "AVK-AC.MOO-PAM" & cyl_name == "PSEG" & dn_min <= dn & dn <= dn_max) %>% 
    select(description_en, kv_b, kv_d, kv_e, zvs, fls)
```

Without the control system, the maximum flow possible the line gives and losses due to fittings and pipe are $370.53\;l/s$. If a "Standard" plunger control valve with a flat portable cylinder is installed in the system, the maximum flow that will circulate through the transport systems will be $369.18\; l/s$ -with a Zeta value of $\zeta_{100\%}=3.8$ and an additional gate valve with a Zeta value of $\zeta_{gate}=0.233$.
